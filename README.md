# Data Science Professional Final Project (IBM Capstone Project)
This is the final project of the data science professional course of IBM, on Coursera. It was a very difficult project to complete,
since it required some skills that we've only skimmed throughout the course, but in conception this is fundamental for building the
base knowledge required to be a data scientist. Putting into practice all the things i learned, or had to learn while doing it was excellent
for my career development.
